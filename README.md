UltraViolet is NYU Libraries' platform for long-term access to a broad range of NYU-related digital content, including open access data associated with research and scholarly output and data licensed for use by members of the NYU community. This repository is the codebase for UltraViolet, a local deployment of the [InvenioRDM framework](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/).

## Overview

Following is an overview of the generated files and folders:

| Name | Description |

| ``Dockerfile`` | Dockerfile used to build your application image. |
| ``Pipfile`` | Python requirements installed via [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io) |
| ``Pipfile.lock`` | Locked requirements (generated on first install). |
| ``app_data`` | Application data such as vocabularies. |
| ``assets`` | Web assets (CSS, JavaScript, LESS, JSX templates) used in the Webpack build. |
| ``docker`` | Example configuration for NGINX and uWSGI. |
| ``docker-compose.full.yml`` | Example of a full infrastructure stack. |
| ``docker-compose.yml`` | Backend services needed for local development. |
| ``docker-services.yml`` | Common services for the Docker Compose files. |

## RDM v11 Caveat

Pipfile automatically installs version of 4.18.a3 of jsonschema which is a pre-release version and thus, unstable. Install
stable version of v4.17.3. 

```
pipenv run pip install -U jsonschema==4.17.3
```

Further, there is no need to install a lower version of setuptools now in Python 3.9 like in the guide at https://nyudlts.github.io/ultraviolet/get-started/dev-docker-setup/. Tested to be working with all custom 
ultraviolet modules - ultraviolet_permissions, ultraviolet_saml, ultraviolet_communities, ultraviolet_cli.
