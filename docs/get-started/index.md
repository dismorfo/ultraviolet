Like the InvenioRDM application, you can run Ultraviolet in two modes:

- Fully Dockerized Mode: Containerized application and services (good for a quick preview).  
- Partially Dockerized Mode: Local dev tools runnig parts of InvenioRDM with containerized services (good for developers) also considered [instance development](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/develop/getting-started/instance-development/#integrating-react-development-modules).

> From the InvenioRDM docs: In the future we aim to move to a **fully containerized development environment.**
